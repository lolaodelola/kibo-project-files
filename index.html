    <h1>Kibo Learning Outcomes</h1>
    <p>
      Kibo exists to increase access to high-quality and affordable education.  We aspire to be “elite but not elitist,” i.e., known for rigor but accessible to anyone who can do the work. The learning principles below are chosen with those goals in mind.
          Learning should be:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="#self-directed">Self-directed</a></li>
      <li><a href="#peer-oriented">Peer-oriented</a></li>
      <li><a href="#active">Active</a></li>
      <li><a href="#relevant">Relevant</a></li>
    </ul>

        <h2>Self-directed</h2>
        <p>
        we believe that education should help students become primary agents of their learning. Because the
        skills professionals need are constantly changing, we help students build the autonomy, self-awareness and discipline needed to (re/un)learn. We minimize scheduled activities, and give students the flexibility to control the time and pace of learning. But, self-directed does not mean isolated. Community plays a key role in motivation, deeper knowledge acquisition and accountability. So, we provide support and relationships to bolster self-directed learning.
      </p>
      </section>
      <section id="peer-oriented">
        <h2>Peer-Oriented</h2>
        <p>
          we believe that students can and should learn from each other. Peers and “near peers” are an asset, and their participation and contribution is required to build a learning community. We expect all students to be teachers, and recognize their ability to create and share knowledge. This does not mean that there is no role for faculty. Our faculty are facilitators, who create/curate engaging learning experiences and guide students in
          their growth.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section id="active">
        <h2>Active</h2>
        <p >
         Research shows that students learn best when they engage in active learning, i.e., learning that involves higher-order thinking. Our courses should strive to help learners do something and connect ideas. Active learning does not rule out specific learning approaches. We strive for project and problem-based learning, discussion, and case-studies. We also recognize there may be instances that warrant a more teacher-led, didactic approach.
      </p>
      </section>
      <section id="relevant">
        <h2>Relevant</h2>
        <p>
          learning experiences, including instruction and assessment, should mirror real-world applications. Students should get the opportunity to “play the whole game,” and use skills as they would in professional settings. They should create artifacts useful outside of academic settings, and have opportunities to iterate and revise their work. Relevance doesn’t mean dismissing academic theory. We value giving students foundational knowledge, but aim to connect to real-world applications where possible.
